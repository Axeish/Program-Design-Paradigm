data definition: think more on alt data definitions


Overall Score: 37__/50

Notes:
Data Design:           2 _/5
1. why is score in world, what if i have 2 balls
2. VELOCITY definition is missing
3. counter should not be posInt
4. coordinates should be center of ball
5. parameters in data definition constructor template are not correct,should be like
  posint or nonnegint
Function Specification:  3_/5
1. ball-off-canvas?  check the signatures
Implementation:         4_/5
1. template for mouse-handler :  use ifelse if you have 2 conditions
(correction):: you should use cond for itemized data and as key event is itemized so it is correct to
          use a cond here. Not deducting any marks for this.
2. world-after-click: strategy is wrong
Style:                  5_/5
1. warning: take care of this :ball-forward: spacing issue
